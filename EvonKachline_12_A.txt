Program Description: 
This program uses numpy to display different statistic with 10 student grades. 
---

Functions: 
1: Function Name: load_CSV(filename):
   Description:  This function brings up and reads the CSV file of grades. 
   Variables: 
	1. reader: This reads the information in the CSV document. 
	2. header: This is the headings of the CSV document.
	3. CSV: This holds all of the information that is written from the CSV file. 
   Logical Steps:
	1: The function will read the CSV file. 
	2: It will then crate the numpy array which will show how the document should be formatted. 
   Returns: The information in the CSV document. 

2: Function name: first_few_rows(CSV, num_rows=5):
   Description: This function will display the first five students grades to show some of the grades.
   Variables: 
	1. CSV: This holds all of the information that is written from the CSV file. 
   Logical Steps: 
	1: This function prints out "First few rows of the grade document:"
	2: It then prints out the first 5 students grades form the CSV document. 
    Return: The first 5 students grades form the CSV document.

3: Function Name: exam_statistics(CSV):
   Description: This function will find the statistic of the three exams for the 10 students.
   Variables:
	1. num_exam: This will read how many exams are on the CVS.
	2. exam_scores: This will read the scores for each exam that are on the CVS.
   Logical Steps:
	1: The program will read all of the scores of the 10 students for each of the three exams. 
	2: With the numpy package it will find out the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum number, and the maximum number for each of the three tests. 
	3: It will then display all of these Mathematical Operations.
   Returns: It will display the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum number, and the maximum number for each of the three tests. 

4: Function Name: overall_statistics(CSV):
   Description: This function gives the statistics of all three exams combined.
   Variables:
	1. all_scores: This holds all of the scores on the CVS.
   Logical Steps:
	1: The program will read all of the scores together of all 10 students. 
	2: With the numpy package it will find out the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum number, and the maximum number all of the test scores. 
	3: It will then display all of these Mathematical Operations.
   Returns:  It will display the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum number, and the maximum number for all of the scores.

5: Function Name: pass_fail(CSV, passing_grade=60):
   Description: 
   Variables:
	1. num_exam: This will read how many exams are on the CVS.
	2. exam_scores: This will read the scores that are on the CVS.
	3. passed: This figures out the sum of the passing scores. 
	4. failed: This figures out the sum of the failed scores.
   Logical Steps:
	1: The program reads all of the scores on the CSV document. 
	2: It will then go though each score in see how many passed or failed. A pass is any score higher then 60.
	3: It will then display how many passed and failed scores for each of the three exams.
   Returns: This displays the number of passed and failed scores for each of the three exams. 
 
6: Function Name: pass_percentage(CSV, passing_grade=60):
   Description: 
   Variables:
	1. total_students: This figures out the total amount of the students on the CSV.
	2. passed_students: This figures out which of the students on the CSV that have passed. 
	3. pass_percentage: This will figure out the percentage of students that passed.
   Logical Steps:
	1: This programs takes all of the numbers of passed and failed scores from pass_fail(CSV, passing_grade=60).
	2: It then figures out what over all percentage of passing scores from all three exams.
	3: It then displays the percentage of how many passing scares there were. 
   Returns:

7: Function Name: main():
   Description: 
   Variables:
	1. filename: This represent the CSV document. 
	2. CSV: This holds all of the information that is written from the CSV file. 
   Logical Steps:
	1: It calls all of the other functions above.
	2: It then tells the program to run all of the functions.  
   Returns: It will display what all of the other functions returns are.

3. CSV: This holds all of the information that is written from the CSV file.
4. num_exam: This will read how many exams are on the CVS.
5. exam_scores: This will read the scores for each exam that are on the CVS. 
6. all_scores: This holds all of the scores on the CVS.
7. passed: This figures out the sum of the passing scores. 
8. failed: This figures out the sum of the failed scores.
9. total_students: This figures out the total amount of the students on the CSV.
10. passed_students: This figures out which of the students on the CSV that have passed. 
11. pass_percentage: This will figure out the percentage of students that passed.
12. filename: This represent the CSV document.

Logical Steps: 
1: The program reads the CSV document. 
2: The program will then display the first 5 students scores of the three exams.
3: The program will then figure out and display the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum number, and the maximum number for each exam. 
4: The program will then do this but with the over all scores. 
5: It will then find and display how many passed and failed scores each exams have. 
6: Last it will display a percentage of all of the passing scores.
