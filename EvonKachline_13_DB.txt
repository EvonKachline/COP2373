Program Description: 
This program will display the population of 10 cities in Florida and then makes charts that show the population growth over 20 years.
---

Functions: 
1: Function Name: population_db():
   Description: This function will make the SQLite database and store the population date from 2023.
   Variables: 
	1. conn: This connects the SQLite database.
	2. cursor: Executes the database. 
	3. starting_population: This has all of the starting population in 2023.
	4. DB_name: Names the database.
	5. Growth_rate: The rate the population goes up.
   Logical Steps:
	1: It first opens up the new data base.
	2: Then it makes a table to show the state and the population growth. 
	3: It then fills in that chart with the 10 cities. 
   Returns: none

2: Function name: population_growth():
   Description:  This will calculate the population growth for the next 20 years. 
   Variables: 
	1. conn: This connects the SQLite database.
	2. cursor: Executes the database. 
	3. data: Store the city names and populations. 
	4. new_population: This has all of the populations after 2023.
	5. DB_name:  Names the database.
	6. Growth_rate: The rate the population goes up.
   Logical Steps: 
	1:  The program first takes all of the city names from the database. 
	2: It then figures out the new populations for the next 20 years.
	3: It then adds these new populations to the chart. 
    Return: None

3: Function Name: plot_population_growth():
   Description: This will display all of the cites so the user can choose one to show the chart. 
   Variables:
	1. conn: This connects the SQLite database.
	2. cursor: Executes the database.
	3. cities: Stores the names of all of the cities in the database.
	4. choice: This stores the choice of the user. 
	5. data: Store the city names and populations. 
	6. years: This takes the years so they can be plotted.
	7. populations: This takes the populations so they can be plotted.
   Logical Steps:
	1: The program will display all 10 cites. 
	2: The user will then select which city they want to look at. 
	3: A chart will then be made and pop up.
	4: When the user exit the chart they can ask to look for anther city.
	5: The program will stop asking when the user press 0.
   Returns: None

4: Function Name: main():
   Description: This holds and calls for the other functions.
   Variables:
	1. none  
   Logical Steps:
	1: It will call for the other functions to run when they are activated. 
   Returns:

Logical Steps: 
1: The program will display all of the 10 cites and ask the user to pick one. 
2: Once the user pick a city the program will make a chart showing the population growth for the next 20 years.
3: When the user exit the chart the program will ask again which city they want to look at.
4: This will repeat until the user types 0.
